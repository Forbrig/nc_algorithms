# nc_algorithms

A bunch of numeric calculus algorithms, mostly done in scilab. Feel free to take a look.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

* To run the projects you need to have [**scilab**](https://www.scilab.org/) on your machine.  

## Run the application:

* Open _xnote_ in scilab and load the algorithm that you want.
* Change the values inside the code.
* Run the algorith by clicking the green arrow on the top.
